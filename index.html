                How do you adjust your sails for money?
            </p>

            <p class="cody">

                Adjusting your sails for the wind of money is getting a job because
                you have no choice but to make money, you can go against the wind by
                not working at all.
            </p>

            <p class="kyle">
                <span>KR</span>

                I guess if you were going against the current then your boat would
                stop moving or topple and youre just stuck out at sea.
            </p>

            <p class="cody">

                The invisible parts about money are that you move with it whether you
                like it or not, if youre working a job theres a lot about it thats
                very visible. You perform this action and you get these amount of
                dollars for that but the invisible aspect of it is how policies are
                shaped at your job. I dont know how you adjust your sails in a way
                that isnt just doing what they tell you to do
            </p>

            <p class="kyle">
                <span>KR</span>

                For me money is so thoroughly invisible, no one uses cash, we use
                credit cards and dont see how much $ you have or are spending. You pay
                rent through direct deposit and you get paid through direct deposit.
                So you could go months or yeas without ever seeing physical cash.
                Talking about policies at work you go to a place and do stuff for them
                and you never receive checks or cash and its like it doesnt exist you
                and everyone just does shit without seeing and exchange.. The richer
                you are or the more money is at stake the more invisible it is.
            </p>

            <p class="kyle">
                <span>KR</span>
                You were also talking about how money relates to sound, how is it?
            </p>

            <p class="cody">

                Well i was thinking about noise complaints and noise pollution being
                tied up in what neighborhood youre in. and whos making the noise
                complaint? Probably a more well to do resident. in lower income
                neighborhoods the noise floor is a little bit higher because you tend
                to be closer to traffic, truck routes, highways, etc.
            </p>

            <p class="cody">
                Experiencing the full frequency spectrum is something you have to pay
                for if you think about it. Your wealth determines whether you can
                appreciate delicate sounds.
            </p>
            <p class="kyle">
                <span>KR</span>

                Silence is like a white box gallery — the “blank slate” absence to
                appreciate single sounds. Like think about Bose, you need a lot of
                money to experience high quality bass and to feel those sonic
                vibrations.
            </p>

            <p class="cody">
                <span>CB</span>
                Yeah, you like actually feel it through your feet and bones and
                everything like the physical air moving out of the speaker.
            </p>

            <p class="kyle">
                <span>KR</span>

                Yeah thinking about bass specifically, I think about how many people
                will have super run down shitty used cars but then have a super nice
                sound system dedicated to having the most insane bass that you hear
                driving by. I always wonder how the people in those cars arent deaf
                because theyre absolutely blasting the shit but I feel like at that
                point its a full body sensory experience.
            </p>

            <p class="cody">
                <span>CB</span>
                Its like it almost has nothing to do with fidelity its about
                transmitting a feeling into your body, not about a high quality single
                its about feeling bass.
            </p>

            <p class="cody">
                I think you could say any sound recording is a wind of itself.
                Recording, or anything that you are doing that you know is being
                captured makes you behave in different ways. This conversation is
                different because were recording it so the surveillance or knowing
                theres a possibility that you could be recorded has an effect on your
                behavior.

                adjusting your sales for money is having a job because you have no
                choice but to make money or you can actually keep doing it oh yeah
                cause I think like not working with like going against the sales of
                money it would be to just like if money is the wind i’m just thinking
                that the invisible parts about money are you kind of like move with
                them whether you like it or not like if you’re working a job there’s a
                lot about that that’s very visible you perform this action and you get
                this amount of dollars for that but like the invisible aspect of it of
                like how policies are shaped or something I just don’t know how the
                how do you adjust your sales for that in a way that’s like not just
                doing what they say yeah I’m just going along with that I mean the
                thing that I think about was invisible money was more just like to
                switch from cash to credit cards and like paying rent through direct
                deposit getting paid through direct deposit or are you just like don’t
                even see money at all for months at a time or you even even what
                you’re talking about with like the policies at work you go to this
                place and do stuff and you never receive a check it just is deposited
                into your account it’s it’s just like doesn’t exist like everyone just
                does shit without ever seeing any money go anywhere. or is there a way
                that cause is there a way that money relieves to sound that you were
                talking about in an invisible way well I was thinking about like noise
                complaints and noise pollution being tied up and what neighborhood
                you’re in there like where who’s making the noise complaint will
                probably be in a more well-to-do resident and then and I like lower
                income neighborhoods are typically it just annoys floor is a little
                bit higher because there’s more another like closer to traffic closer
                to truck Routsong sooooo experiencing like the full frequency spectrum
                is some thing that you have to pay for if you think about the noise
                floor like that yeah your wealth determines whether you can like
                appreciate this delicate sounds yeah or that you can even have it’s
                almost like silence is the same as like a white gallery like that you
                can have full absence to appreciate a single sound but like only rich
                people can afford to have nothing yeah I think the Bose interesting to
                think about having like high-quality base as I don’t know of a money
                sound link you get to feel those sonic vibrations of the base of the
                sample because it’s exactly the same thing that’s happening in all the
                other frequency ranges but the base you like actually feel it through
                your feet and bones and everything of like the physical air moving out
                of the wind yeah yeah I think with base specifically to I think about
                like how many shitty cars there are with like super nice sound systems
                dedicated to just like having the most insane bass and I was just like
                any always wonder how the people in those cars if they’re how they’re
                not deaf because they’re just absolutely blasting shit but I feel like
                at that point it’s just like a full body sensory experience all alarms
                like that’s like almost has nothing to do with Fidelity it’s just
                about like transmitting feeling into your body it’s not like oh I’m
                hearing like a high-quality signal I was like I’m hearing Bass
                Recording and like any kind of when you’re when you know what you’re
                doing is being captured you’re behaving in different ways over our
                conversation is different because were recording it so the
                surveillance is another wind surveillance is a lighter version of that
                for the possibility that you could be recorded as is it has an affect
                on your behavior wow and seen the van
